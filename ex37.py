#1. Find out what a “flow chart” is and write a few.
#2. If you find errors in code you are reading, try to fix them and send the author your changes.
#3. Another technique for when you are not using paper is to put # comments with your notes in the code. Sometimes, these could become the actual comments to help the next person.
# P.S. Rick says Ms. Tina says we should do it this way.
#start
blah = 10
if blah > 10:
    print("yay! blah is greater than 10")
elif blah == 10:
    print("fair enough, blah is equal to 10")
else:
    print("booo! blah is less than 10")
#end
